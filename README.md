# zima brand rebranding
Zima was a bevrage brand which was discontinued but now we are rebranding it  and making website so that it can compete in modern-era .This zima website work and functions throuhly . I have considered all the valuable points which includes majority of user experirnece and other  interactive executions in a website first of all it start with hover effects over the nav bar after that  images  can scale when we put cursor over them .Eventhought  we can see the infographical box pop-up for each team meamber when clicked on image of team member. I also make a sign-up page in wich user can login or sign-up and become member of Zima .
